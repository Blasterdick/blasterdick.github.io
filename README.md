#### Here lay some random commands that I found useful once.

Moved this from Notion pages with [loconotion](https://github.com/leoncvlt/loconotion) and this command:

    LOCONOTION_LOCAL_DIST=/tmp docker-compose run loconotion https://www.notion.so/unique-page-url
    cp -r /tmp/export-directory/* /github-pages/repo/directory/
